A simple command line unit converter.

The converter gives the user three options for unit types to convert
and then takes the user to a submenu for that unit type. The program
then requests what unit to convert from, the quantity of that unit,
and what unit to convert to. It then displays the converted value
rounded to four decimal places.

After the calculation, the program will loop back to the last submenu
the user was in and will continue this process until the user chooses 
to return to the main menu. From here the user can either exit or select
another unit type to convert.

Below is an example run output of the program.
